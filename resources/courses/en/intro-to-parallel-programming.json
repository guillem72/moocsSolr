    "description": "Learn the fundamentals of parallel computing with the GPU and the CUDA programming environment! In this class, you'll learn about parallel programming by coding a series of image processing algorithms, such as you might find in Photoshop or Instagram. You'll be able to program and run your assignments on high-end GPUs, even if you don't own one yourself.  \n\n**Why Itâ€™s Important to Think Parallel**  \n\n[Third Pillar of Science][1]  \nLearn how scientific discovery can be accelerated by combining theory and experimentation with computing to fight cancer, prevent heart attacks, and spur new advances in robotic surgery.\n\n[1]: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3DbAB2ChDBw",
