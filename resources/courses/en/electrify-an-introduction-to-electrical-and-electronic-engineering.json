    "description": "Engineering is all about using science to make the world a better place and touches our everyday lives; the device you’re reading this on wouldn’t exist if it wasn’t for electrical and electronic engineers!\n\nIn Electrify we’ll cover six different areas of electrical and electronic engineering over the six weeks:\n\nElectromechanics\n  DC Circuits\n  AC Circuits\n  Digital Electronics\n  Analogue Electronics\n  Introduction to C Programming\nEach week is a topic in it’s own right, so if you find one week difficult the next week will give you something rather different to think about.\n\nYou won’t find a hard hat or a spanner anywhere in this course, we’ll be focussing on how engineers use their brains to solve problems and to give a taste of some of the topics a degree level course in Electrical and Electronic Engineering may include.\n\nIf you’d like to meet up and chat with your fellow participants before the course starts, get extra updates and have access to special offers and competitions, you can join our Facebook group.",
