    "description": "Big Data is an extraordinary knowledge revolution that is sweeping almost invisibly through business, academia, government, healthcare, and everyday life. It already enables us to provide a healthier life for our children, ensure safety and independence for older people, conserve precious resources like water and energy, and peer into our own individual genetic makeup.The term “Big Data” describes the accumulation and analysis of vast amounts of information. But Big Data is much more than big data. It’s also the ability to extract meaning: to sort through masses of numbers and find the hidden patterns, unexpected correlations, and surprising connections.One of the biggest impacts of Big Data is in business. Companies that adopt “data-driven decision making” enjoy significantly greater productivity than those that do not.In this course, you’ll learn from real life use cases what it takes to extract that value from Big Data, and which solutions are available to acquire, store, analyze, and act on Big Data. We will also introduce SAP Rapid Deployment solutions, which help businesses adopt Big Data solutions and related technology. We will demonstrate how all this is done in a live system and provide course participants with access to the system to perform the steps themselves.During the first week of the course we will talk about the value behind Big Data. We will look at real use cases where enterprises managed to drive success based on information hidden in Big Data. We will also feature segments of the documentary about “The Human Face of Big Data”, a global media project focusing on the new ability to collect, analyze, triangulate, and visualize vast amounts of data in real time.In the second week we take a deep dive into SAP’s Big Data solutions. You’ll learn which technologies are used to collect, integrate, and store Big Data. We also cover a range of applications and analytical tools we have at our disposal to extract the hidden secrets from massive amounts of data and drive business success.The last three weeks are dedicated to SAP Rapid Deployment solutions, which help customers to quickly adopt key innovations in SAP Big Data solutions and technologies. You’ll learn how best practices, proven methodologies, and pre-configured content make adopting innovations simple and predictable. You will see how the SAP Big Data rapid-deployment solutions lower the complexity of implementation projects, and hence project risks, while accelerating time to value.",
