    "description": "Through this course, students will acquire a solid foundation \nin algebra and trigonometry. The course concentrates on the various \nfunctions that are important to the study of the calculus. Emphasis is \nplaced on understanding the properties of linear, polynomial, piecewise, \nexponential, logarithmic and trigonometric functions. Students will \nlearn to work with various types of functions in symbolic, graphical, \nnumerical and verbal form.THE SIGNATURE TRACK OPTION\nSignature Track is an optional path you may choose for this course. \nBy signing up and paying a nominal fee (financial aid can be provided), \nyou can add a higher level of identity verification to your Coursera \ncoursework. If you achieve the threshold score,\n    you have the opportunity to earn a Verified Certificate. For each assignment, your identity is \nconfirmed through your photo and unique typing pattern. If you earn a \nVerified Certificate, you will also be given a\n    personal URL through which your course records can be shared with \nemployers and educational institutions.Click here for more information on the Signature Track option.LICENSEThe course videos are licensed Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike-NonCommercial 3.0.
