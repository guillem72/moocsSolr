We will take designs created in the Mobile Game Design\ncourse and bring them to life. The course will teach you fundamentals of game\ndevelopment like: scenes, nodes, animation, physics, collision, particle\nsystems, sound, and more. You will also learn to incorporate some basic\nartificial intelligence to keep score and manage lives. Towards the end you\nwill have a fully functional game called Space Cat that teaches everything you\nneed to know to build a game of your own.",
