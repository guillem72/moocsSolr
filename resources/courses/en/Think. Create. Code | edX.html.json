    "description": "Learn how to create your own artistic images and animations and display them in our online gallery, which has now been enhanced to suit self-paced learners.\n\nOur world is becoming increasingly digitized. For many of us, barely a day goes past without recording a video, taking and editing photos, and sharing digital content across multiple applications. But how well do we understand the technology we're using, and how is digital information created and manipulated?\n\nWith many careers today involving some form of computation, there is a growing urgency for individuals to move beyond digital literacy, to understand how digital technologies work, and to develop literacy in code. This course will help you acquire it.\n\nIn this course, you will not only learn the inner workings of your digital world, but also create and manipulate images with code, creating new artworks and interactive animations. Your images and animations will be displayed in an online Art Gallery, forming part of a vibrant learning community.\n\nYou will also develop effective computational thinking skills and concepts transferable to other coding environments and programming languages. Computational thinking skills.\n\tIntroductory programming concepts, such as sequencing, iteration and selection.\n\tSkills and knowledge of how to create art and basic animations with ProcessingJS.\n\tPreparation for study of computer science or other programming languages.",
