    "description": "The Mobile Cloud Computing with Android (MoCCA) Specialization comprises six content area courses plus a final Capstone project. It is available to students who have passed all six previous courses in the series with Verified Certificates and provides an opportunity to integrate and demonstrate the knowledge they've acquired across the courses. The MoCCA Capstone course will offer students multiple projects to choose from. Each project will be described by a lightweight project specification. Each student will select one project to implement and will be expected to complete it over roughly eight weeks working roughly 8-12 hours per week (though students are free to devote as much time as theyâ€™d like to the project). This Capstone MOOC gives students who have passed all previous courses with Verified Certificates in the Mobile Cloud Computing with Android Specialization. It is an opportunity to integrate and demonstrate the knowledge they've acquired across the six earlier content area courses.",
    "contents": "The capstone will require students to develop a complex mobile cloud computing application from the ground up. Grading will be done via a mix of automated grading and peer assessment. The capstone project will first be run once. If it is successful, it will be run multiple times.",
