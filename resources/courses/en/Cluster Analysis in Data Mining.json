    "description": "Discover the basic concepts of cluster analysis, and then study a set of typical clustering methodologies, algorithms, and applications. This includes partitioning methods such as k-means, hierarchical methods such as BIRCH, density-based methods such as DBSCAN\/OPTICS, probabilistic models, and the EM algorithm. Learn clustering and methods for clustering high dimensional data, streaming data, graph data, and networked data. Explore concepts and methods for constraint-based clustering and semi-supervised clustering. Finally, see examples of cluster analysis in applications. Learn how to take scattered data and organize it into groups for use in many applications, such as market analysis and biomedical data analysis, or as a pre-processing step for many data mining tasks.",
