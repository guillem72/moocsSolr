    "description": "This course reviews the topics for\nthe AP Calculus AB Exam.&nbsp;\n\nThe course is divided into two\nparts.&nbsp; Part 1 is Differential Calculus\nand incorporates mostly AB topics but does have some BC topics.&nbsp; Part 2 is Integral Calculus, and again is mostly\nAB material.&nbsp; The BC material that is not\ncovered in either of these parts will be reviewed in an extension. \n\nEach week&nbsp;of the six week\nreview will include review videos for an important block of material, complete\nwith&nbsp;videos of worked example problems and exam tips. There will also be\nan extensive&nbsp;online quiz given each week, with multiple problem versions\nthat students can use to practice, along with practice tests to help\nstudents prepare for the AP* Calculus AB Exam.\n\n* AP Calculus is a registered trademark of the College Board, which was not\ninvolved in the production of, and does not endorse, this product.\n\n This is a 6 week course covering the first part of AP* Calculus which includes limits, derivatives and applications.\n\n* AP Calculus is a registered trademark of the College Board, which was not involved in the production of, and does not endorse, this product.",
