    "description": "This class teaches you how to build powerful web and mobile apps and host them in the cloud, without writing a line of code.\n\nBy the end of this short course, you'll use the skills you've developed to conceptualize and create your own app. To get you there, your instructors Samantha and Andy will first help you build an app that could be used to manage logistics at a music festival. Though this is a very specific app use case, the skills you learn will be applicable to just about any business app youâ€™d want to develop.",
