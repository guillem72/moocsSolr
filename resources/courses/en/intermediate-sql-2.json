    "description": "Expand your knowledge of Structured Query Language (SQL), the industry\nstandard database programming language. In this course, you'll learn\ntechniques that will enable you to write powerful queries that perform\ncomplicated searches and sorts on your data. First, you'll explore how to\nwrite and implement complex queries on multiple tables simultaneously and how\nto apply advanced filtering techniques. You'll learn to create union queries\nthat combine records from multiple queries, and you'll discover how to use\nunion queries to exclude or include duplicate records. In addition, you'll\nfind out how to use text strings within union queries. Next, you'll master\nadvanced techniques for updating various types of data stored in your tables.\nYou'll learn how to update a single field, multiple fields, multiple records,\ndate fields, and calculated fields. And you'll see how to update and set NULL\nvalues using an update statement. In addition, you'll use advanced insertion\ntechniques to add data to your tables and learn how to create, query, and\nmodify temporary tables. You'll also see how to implement techniques to handle\nduplicate values stored in a table and how to limit the results of a result\nset. And finally, you'll discover how to use string functions to perform\ncomplicated searches on strings, how to implement date and time functions to\ninsert and extract portions of a date, and how to create queries that accept\ninput from users. By the end of this course, you'll be able to use a wide\nrange of advanced SQL techniques with confidence. Your new skills with\ndatabases will enhance your competitiveness in the technical fields of\nsoftware development and database administration.",
