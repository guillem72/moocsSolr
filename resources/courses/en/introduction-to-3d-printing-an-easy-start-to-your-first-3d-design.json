    "description": "This class will teach you exactly how to model a 3D hand-held, print-ready, object using only free tools, with no prior experience necessary. \n\nIf you've been on the internet in the last year you've probably read an article (or two, or three) about 3D printing and how it's shaping the future of product design forever. Magic! \nThis class will uncover the core processes behind the hype and share one of the most special qualities of the 3D printing revolution: that it's accessible to anyone and companies like Shapeways, where I work as a Designer Evangelist, are making the process easier than ever. \nWhat You'll Learn\nWhat is 3D Printing? We'll define what 3D printing is, why it's gotten so much attention as of late and what its potential could be. \nDesigning from Sketch. We'll also discuss a second way to produce your 3D model - designing from a sketch with a whole host of free software options. \nFrom Model to Product. We'll walk through what your next steps would be to get your design printed - what pricing to expect, how it works and where to get it done. \n\nWhat You'll Make\nYou'll model your own 3D design for a hand-held object using free software options we'll cover in class. Customize your object (think monograms, colors) and leave this class ready to print! ",
