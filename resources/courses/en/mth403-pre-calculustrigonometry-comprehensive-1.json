    "description": "Pre-calculus weaves together previous study of algebra, geometry, and\nfunctions into a preparatory course for calculus. The course focuses on the\nmastery of critical skills and exposure to new skills necessary for success in\nsubsequent math courses. Topics include linear, quadratic, exponential,\nlogarithmic, radical, polynomial, and rational functions; systems of\nequations; and conic sections in the first semester. The second semester\ncovers trigonometric ratios and functions; inverse trigonometric functions;\napplications of trigonometry, including vectors and laws of cosine and sine;\npolar functions and notation; and arithmetic of complex numbers. Cross-\ncurricular connections are made throughout the course to calculus, art,\nhistory, and a variety of other fields related to mathematics. K¹² Scope &\nSequence documents for each course include: Note: Materials lists are subject\nto revision and may vary slightly from state to state.",
