    "description": "This\nis a course about the fundamentals of the online\/digital world.&nbsp; It’s aim to provide a set of concepts and\ntools with which to view online developments.&nbsp;\nThese concepts are the language and the vocabulary which can explain and\nalso predict how technology impacts different industries.The\ncourse is not an overview of EC or IT developments but rather ways in which we\ncan make sense of EC and IT developments.&nbsp;\nThus, the emphasis is not on the “what” but on the “why.”In\nthe first 5 weeks, different concepts and their significance are explained. &nbsp;The role of these concepts in explaining the\nsuccess of dominant, marquee companies is also discussed.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn\nthe 6th and final week, participants observe how these concepts apply\nto different contexts.&nbsp; These contexts\nare case studies of multiple companies. Actual class discussions are shown to\nillustrate how the concepts can be used to understand and predict IT-driven\ntransformations. The aim of this course is to understand issues that companies need to address when moving from being offline to online and learn how companies can craft business models where IT is embedded as an integral part of products, processes and customer interactions. You would get to appreciate how IT is changing the way companies create value through networks and coopetition.",
