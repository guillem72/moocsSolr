    "description": "This class will cover an introduction to command line tools for managing genomic data. It will start with basic Unix commands for managing files and directories, followed by a review of the main starndardized data formats and hands-on instruction on how to use popular tools such as Samtools, Bedtools, Bowtie, and application specific technologies such as Bcftools and Cufflinks.&nbsp;This course has a $99 value but being offered at a significant discount. Introduces to the commands that you need to manage and analyze directories, files, and large sets of genomic data. This is the fourth course in the Genomic Big Data Science Specialization from Johns Hopkins University.",
