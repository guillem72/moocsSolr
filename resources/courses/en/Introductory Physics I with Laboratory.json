    "description": "\n    We will investigate motion in the world around us; we welcome both those\n        who want to participate fully and those who wish to sample, cafeteria-style,\n        the activities of this course. &nbsp;Those who participate fully will experience\n        a course that is very different in style but equivalent (at least) in core\n        content to a traditional, on-campus, first-semester college-level introductory\n        physics course that includes a laboratory. At the same time, those who\n        cherry-pick selected course elements (e.g., learning the basics of video\n        capture and analysis of motion in one’s own surroundings) will still advance\n        their understanding of physics. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n        \n    \n    We aim to understand and to predict motion in the real world using a small\n        set of powerful fundamental principles. The laboratories are the backbone\n        of this course, providing opportunities (1) to observe and to analyze motion\n        in our own surroundings, (2) to apply fundamental principles to build explanations\n        of the motion, and (3) to evaluate, in a constructively critical way, our\n        own measurements and models, as well as the measurements and models of\n        our course peers. Other course elements (lecture videos with “clicker”\n        questions, homework) support and extend the physics explored in the laboratories.Participants\n    who satisfactorily complete the course will be eligible for six (6) Continuing\n    Education Units from the American Association of Physics Teachers.&nbsp; Explore motion in the real world using modern tools and techniques (video capture and analysis, computer modeling) guided by fundamental physics principles.",
