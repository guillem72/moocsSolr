    "description": "Raw image data from a digital camera needs processing by a computer to turn it from a simple binary record to a beautiful visual image. While profiles and presets can do a good job, it always takes some human intervention to get things just right. In this course you will learn a solid creative and technical foundation for working with images, and you will practice a processing methodology that takes the guesswork out of post-processing. Although this course is delivered in Adobe Lightroom, the principles and methodology learned here are also easily transferable to similar software, such as Adobe Camera Raw and Capture One Pro.",
