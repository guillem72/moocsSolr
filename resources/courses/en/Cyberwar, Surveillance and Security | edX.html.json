    "description": "Once heralded as the ultimate vehicle for open communication and self-expression, the internet is rapidly becoming a globally networked surveillance device. Serious threats to national security, combined with the seemingly endless capacity of digital processing and storage, have led to levels of data capture and 24\/7 monitoring of individuals’ activity that were unimaginable even a decade ago.\n \nWith resistance to such practices rising, this course will equip you to take an active part in the debate. You will gain a broad understanding of the competing tensions of the laws related to national security and personal and commercial privacy in the post-Snowden online environment, and grasp the looming consequences of this battle for peace, sovereignty, human rights and the internet itself.\n  New insights into the extent, purposes and impact of global networked surveillance technologies\n\tKnowledge of the nature and consequences of cyber-activism and cyberwar\n\tUnderstanding of the spectrum of responses to the complexity of issues involved in online surveillance and security",
