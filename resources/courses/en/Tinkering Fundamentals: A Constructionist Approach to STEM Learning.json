    "description": "The Tinkering Fundamentals course offers educators and enthusiasts an opportunity to develop a practice of tinkering and making. &nbsp;We see tinkering as a serious endeavor--one that is generalizable across content and especially good at interweaving disciplines in a way that leads to complex projects and individualized learning opportunities. &nbsp;Tinkering has recently been introduced into the educational field as a potential driver of creativity, excitement, and innovation in science learning. It is seen by many as an effective means to engage in exploring STEM concepts, practices and phenomena. For over a decade, the Exploratorium has been developing science-rich tinkering activities. Working with learning scientists, we have identified a set of design principles and indicators of learning that can help you to integrate tinkering activities into your elementary and middle school science programs.&nbsp;Tinkering typically blends the high- and low-tech tools of science along with a strong aesthetic dimension that supports self-expression among children as well as&nbsp;adults. &nbsp;This course focuses on key design elements of high quality, science-rich tinkering activities, along with helpful facilitation strategies, and tips for organizing the learning environment. Selected tinkering activities are centered on circuits for this course. &nbsp;We review the ways in which tinkering supports science learning by providing opportunities to deepen engagement, intentionality, innovation, collaboration, and understanding. This course will excite you, inspire you, and get you tinkering in no time.NOTE: This is a hands-on workshop, so you need to obtain or purchase course&nbsp;materials as soon as possible. Material bundles are available from the Exploratorium store online at www.artoftinkering.com, or you can gather your own supplies using our&nbsp;recommended materials list. Tinkering activities provide a powerful way to inspire students' interest, engagement, and understanding in science. The Tinkering Fundamentals course will help educators and enthusiasts develop a practice of tinkering and making. This course will focus on key design elements of high-quality, science-rich tinkering activities, effective facilitation strategies and environmental organization.",
    "contents": "Week One: Introduction to TinkeringWhat is tinkering? Is it different from engineering or other forms of making?Week Two: Initial ExplorationsWhat better way to learn about tinkering than to try it! We invite you to start by playing with circuit boards.Week Three: Learning DimensionsThis week, it's scribbling machines! We'll also investigate how tinkering maps on to different indicators of learning.Week Four: Tinkering Tenets and Personal ExpressionTry your hand with paper circuits and sewn circuits, and explore the aesthetic dimensions of tinkering, including key design elements and basic principles.Week Five: Coding, Computation and Facilitation StrategiesA look at the high-tech side of tinkering, plus strategies for facilitation and deep engagement.Week Six: Putting It All TogetherHow will you take what you've learned in this class and apply it to your own life? We'll help you come up with a detailed action plan and get feedback from other students in the class.",
