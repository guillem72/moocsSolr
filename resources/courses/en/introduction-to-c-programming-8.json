    "description": "This C programming course, designed by instructor Hitesh Choudhary, is designed to give a detailed idea about C programming to new users who have little to no experience in that subject. For those who want to learn C in a very short period of time, with baby steps along the way, this is an ideal place to start.We'll start with the Installation of C environment, before moving on to variables, datatypes, and loops. From there, the course will move on to more advanced topics such as functions, pointers , structures, and unions. In supplement, every user (after a small assignment) will get a unique ID certification, that can be verified online as well.",
