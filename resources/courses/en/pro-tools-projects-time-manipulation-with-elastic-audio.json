    "description": "Fully integrated elastic audio was introduced in Pro Tools version 7.4 and\ngave editors the time-saving advantage of being able to change an audio file's\ntempo or timing in real time without the need to render the audio. In _Pro\nTools Projects: Time Manipulation with Elastic Audio_, author Brian Lee White\nshows how to adjust tempo, change pitch, and quantize audio tracks with\nelastic audio. This course covers auto-conforming audio loops and regions to a\nsessionâ€™s tempo, enabling elastic audio on tracks, and using the five elastic\naudio plug-ins to extract as much fidelity as possible from the source\nmaterial. Exercise files are included with the course.",
