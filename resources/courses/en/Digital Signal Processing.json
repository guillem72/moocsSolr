    "description": "The goal of the course is to develop a complete working set of digital signal processing notions from the ground up. DSP is arguably at the heart of the “digital revolution” that, in the space of just a few decades, has enabled unprecedented levels of interpersonal communication and of information availability.  In the class, starting from the basic definitions of a discrete-time signal, we will work our way through Fourier analysis, filter design, sampling, interpolation and quantization to build a DSP toolset complete enough to analyze a practical communication system in detail. Hands-on examples and demonstration will be routinely used to close the gap between theory and practice. Learn the fundamentals of digital signal processing theory and discover the myriad ways DSP makes everyday life more productive and fun.",
    "contents": "Broad outline of the topics covered in the class: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction: What is signal processing, history of the topic, application examples.Discrete-time (DT) signals: the discrete-time complex exponential, and a computer music synthesis example.Euclid and Hilbert: Signal processing as geometry, vectors spaces, bases, approximations.Fourier Analysis: The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and series (DFS). The discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT). Examples. The fast Fourier transform algorithm (FFT).Linear Filters: Linear time-invariant systems, convolution, ideal and realizable filters. Filter design and implementation, examples.Interpolation and Sampling: Continuous-time (CT) signals, interpolation, sampling. The sampling theorem as orthonormal basis expansion. Processing of CT signals in DT.Stochastic Signal Processing and Quantization: Stochastic signals, quantization, analog-to-digital (ADC) and digital-to-analog (DAC) conversion.Image Processing: Introduction to image processing and two-dimensional (2D) Fourier analysis. Filtering and compression. The JPEG compression standard.Digital Communication Systems: Analog channels and bandwidth\/power constraints. Modulation and demodulation. Transmitter and receiver design. ADSL.",
    "requirements": "Fundamentals of linear algebra and calculus are a must. Familiarity with probability theory and system theory are highly recommended. Familiarity with Matlab (or equivalent) and\/or scientific programming are a plus.",
