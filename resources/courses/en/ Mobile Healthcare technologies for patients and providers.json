    "contents": "This course intends to provide senior undergraduate and entry-level graduate students an introduction to Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI) that covers: (1) informatics needs driven by Big Data generated from current biomedicine and health care (e.g., cancer, cardiovascular disease, aging population, etc.); (2) informatics challenges and common methodologies; and (3) progress made in BHI and opportunities. &nbsp;Health monitoring involves sensing, personal health records, and clinical decision making. The typical clinical process includes disease screening\/diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. &nbsp;Using examples from chronic condition monitoring and clinical care, this course reviews the typical flow of clinical information, which includes the following steps: (1) data acquisition, storage, and curation; (2) data analysis, mining, and visualization; (3) modeling; (4) decision support; and (5) delivery (point-of-care access). Various introductory topics in bioinformatics, imaging informatics, and health informatics are organized as below:Review of Basic Knowledge in Biostatistics, Machine Learning and Data Mining, Visualization, and Decision SupportHigh-Throughput â€“omic Informatics and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)&nbsp;Molecular and Cellular Imaging Informatics for Next-Generation Pathology (NGP)Mobile Health and Health InformaticsModeling for Systems Biology and Medicine",
