We'll relate the cloud to things you encounter every\nday, using practical, non-technical language. We'll start by looking at the\nbuilding blocks of the cloud, where it started, and how it transitioned from\nan experiment into an unstoppable force. You'll also gain a clear\nunderstanding of IaaS, SaaS, and PaaS, and see why each may be attractive to\nsome businesses, but not others. And you'll learn about the different kinds of\nclouds (public, private, and hybrid). We'll also take an inside look at the\nengine rooms of the cloud: data centers. You'll examine the concept of big\ndata?the overwhelmingly huge amounts of data that make analysis so\nchallengingâ€”and how the cloud infrastructure enables data to zip across the\nglobe at lightning speed.

We'll examine how Facebook and\nTwitter contribute to the cloud, and how apps go from idea to app store.\nYou'll gain an understanding of how mobile devices and major mobile\necosystems?like Apple, Android, and Windows?continue to shape the cloud, and\nhow start-ups can use social media to shake things up like never before. So\ncome see how the how the cloud can work for you! Whatever your technical\nbackground, by the end of this course, you'll be thoroughly cloud-savvy.",
