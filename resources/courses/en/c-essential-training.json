    "description": "Widely used for both systems and application development, C is a powerful\nlanguage at the heart of many more modern languages, like JavaScript and\nObjective-C. In this course, professor Isac Artzi dissects the anatomy of C,\nfrom data types, strings, and variables to simple functions. He'll show how\nthese basic elements fit together in control structures like loops and if-else\nstatementsâ€”where the real logic behind your code comes into play. Plus, learn\nhow C organizes information into arrays and how you can manage memory\nresources with pointers.  \n  \nC is a great first step for new programmers, and a way to broaden and deepen\nyour knowledge if you've already programmed for a while. Press Play to start\nlearning.",
