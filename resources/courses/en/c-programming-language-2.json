    "description": "The C programming language is a structure oriented programming language, developed at Bell Laboratories in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie.  C programming language features were derived from an earlier language called “B” (Basic Combined Programming Language – BCPL).  C language was invented for implementing UNIX operating system.  In 1978, Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan published the first edition  “The C Programming Language” and commonly known as K&R.  In 1983, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) established a committee to provide a modern, comprehensive definition of C. The resulting definition, the ANSI standard, or “ANSI C”, was completed late 1988.",
