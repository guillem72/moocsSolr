    "description": "Many products are developed based on a hunch, a judgement call, and incomplete\ninformation. Needless to say, most of them fail miserably. Startup founders\nand business owners then ask themselves why. This course takes a different,\nrisk-mitigating, more scientific approach to the art of starting a business.\nYou’ll learn how to develop a product people really need by uncovering these\nneeds well in advance. Before you write one line of code, before you hire a\nlarge team, before you take a big risk. You’ll learn the ins and outs of\nlearning if people need your product by implementing three activities to learn\nfrom your future customers - Experience Sampling, Field Observation, and\nInterviewing. After making sense of it all, you’ll be able to kick-start your\nbusiness with confidence in your knowledge and wisdom.",
