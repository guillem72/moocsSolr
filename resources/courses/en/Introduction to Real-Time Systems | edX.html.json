    "description": "This computer science course provides an overview on designing and analyzing real-time operating systems (RTOS). Found in most mission critical and infrastructure systems, real-time systems are both challenging and rewarding to build. \n\nDerived from the course instructor’s ground-breaking text on the subject, learn about real-time systems from one of the leading educators in the field.\n\nA minimum understanding of computing principles at a high school level is suggested. Join us as we adventure into the world of real-time systems. What is so different and special about real-time systems\n\tUnique challenges in the requirements and specifications for real-time systems\n\tIntroduction to real-time operating systems design\n\tAn overview of how to build real-time systems",
