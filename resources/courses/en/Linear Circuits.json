    "description": "This course is a first introduction to electrical systems. It includes\nthe analysis of circuits including resistors, capacitors, and inductors\nwith DC and AC sources in the time domain and in the frequency domain.\nLaboratory demonstrations are given to reinforce the concepts learned from\nthe lectures and homework. The course is targeted at people with a scientific\nor technical background who are not electrical or computer engineers. The\ncoverage is not as deep as a circuits course aimed at electrical engineers.\nThere are a number of physical applications demonstrated in this course\nthat serve to motivate this topic to a wider audience. The course is ideal\nfor someone who wants to gain a basic understanding of electrical circuits,\nsomeone who wants to get better intuition for what they have already learned,\nprecocious hobbyists, or for someone who is considering electrical engineering\nas a career. Learn the analysis of circuits including resistors, capacitors, and inductors.  This course is directed towards people who are in science or engineering fields outside of the disciplines of electrical or computer engineering.  ",
    "contents": "This course is broken into five Modules, each having associated homework\nand a quiz:\n\nModule 1: Background:\n    Background information on electricity, resistors, and circuit diagrams\n\nModule 2: Resistive Circuits:\n    Ohm's Law, Kirchhoff's Law, Resistors in series and in parallel, Systematic\n    Solution Methods, Physical applications, and Lab demos\n\nModule 3: Reactive Circuits:&nbsp;Capacitors, Inductors, First and Second Order Differential Equations,\n    RC and RL and RLC circuit steady-state and transient response to a DC source, Physical applications, Lab demos\n\nModule 4: Frequency Analysis:\n    AC response, Impedance, Transfer functions, Frequency response, Filtering,\n    Applications, Lab demos\n\nModule 5:\n    Real and reactive power, power factor, transformers\nEach module has a quiz associated with it, where the modules that take\nlonger are assigned more credit in grading. &nbsp;Each week has a homework\nassociated with it that is due at the end of the week.\n",
