To humanize software experience through design, you must focus on users’ needs and expectations. Achieving success requires more than just efficient software implementation or simply providing new functions. End users expect intuitive solutions that make it easy for them to perform their daily tasks, anywhere with any device. Meeting users’ needs has become a key differentiator. In this course, you will learn about the business value that can be achieved with great user experience.Our customers have already taken a step further in understanding their end users, establishing design practices that can guide their companies towards a more human-centric perspective.
