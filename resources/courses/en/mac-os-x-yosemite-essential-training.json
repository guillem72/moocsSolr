    "description": "Learn all the ins and outs of Yosemite, Apple's Mac OS X 10.10 operating\nsystem. Staff author Nick Brazzi starts with a tour of the core interface\nelements—the menus, Finder, and Dock—so you can start working with files,\nfolders, and applications right away. He then shows how to save files and find\nthem again quickly, as well as use the core applications that come bundled\nwith Yosemite (Mail, Calendar, iMessage, iTunes, and Safari), and install new\napps from the Apple Store. Finally, the course explores sharing over a\nnetwork, and backing up your system, manually or with Time Machine, so you\ndon't lose any important data.",
