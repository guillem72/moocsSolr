    "description": "Digital systems are at the heart of the information age in which we live, allowing us to store, communicate and manipulate information quickly and reliably. This computer science course is a bottom-up exploration of the abstractions, principles, and techniques used in the design of digital and computer systems. If you have a rudimentary knowledge of electricity and some exposure to programming, roll up your sleeves, join in and design a computer system!\n\nUsing your browser for design entry and simulation, you’ll implement a 32-bit computer using our gate library and write assembly language programs to explore the hardware\/software interface.\n\nThis is Part 2 of a 3-part program on digital systems. The design of an instruction set for computer systems\n\tHow to translate high-level programs into sequences of computer instructions\n\tThe design of the datapath and control logic for a 32-bit computer\n\tThe role of caches in the memory hierarchy",
