    "description": "This statistics and data analysis course will pave the statistical foundation for our discussion on data science.\n\nYou will learn how data scientists exercise statistical thinking in designing data collection, derive insights from visualizing data, obtain supporting evidence for data-based decisions and construct models for predicting future trends from data.\n\nThis is the first course in the three-part Data Science and Analytics XSeries. Data collection, analysis and inference\n\tRelationship between variables\n\tTypes of association\n\tConditional probability\n\tBayes’ Rule\n\tGoals of data visualization\n\tStatistical comparisons that underlie data graphics\n\tHow Bayesian inference is used to combine sources of information\n\tIdentify situations where Bayesian modeling can be useful",
