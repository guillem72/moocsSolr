    "description": "In this course we'll be jumping right into the action and building out the basic functionality of two real game projects. Using the Canvas framework, EaselJS, we'll make a simple tile-based puzzle game and a scrolling space shooter. You should already have a fundamental understanding of the Canvas APIs, or you can check out Canvas Essentials, a starter course which will get you up to speed with what's going on under the hood.",
