    "description": "The purpose of this four-week learning exchange is to bring together\norganizations, teachers, students, and community stakeholders to assist\nelementary and middle school students choose a STEM career pathway by\nexploring topics and problems surrounding space weather through the lens of\nNASA's Multiscale Magnetosphere Mission.\n\n**Course Objectives**  \n\n1\\. To prepare and teach middle school students how to quickly and efficiently\nmonitor progress of an entire solar storm from the time it erupts from the sun\nand magnetic field. To do this, participants will engage in the following\nactivities.\n\n  * Predict which sunspots may be a source of solar storms and identify this within an online learning platform. \n  * Discover when solar storms occur and predict which solar storms will affect Earth in an online learning community. \n  * Measure disturbances of Earth’s magnetic field and predict auroras. \n  * Identify when aurora viewing is most desirable. \n  * Create an object to teach the local community about solar storm weather reports employing a monitoring system already developed.\n\n2\\. To generate interest among students, teachers, and stakeholder in STEM\ncareers in relation to solar storms and the study of heliophysics using a real\nworld scenario and event.\n\n3\\. To assist in the development of STEM elementary and middle school programs\nvia the arts through the construction of a learning artifact or object that\ncan be shared with a wider learning community.",
