    "description": "Go from project brief to mock-up.\r\n\r\nIt’s impossible to deny the influence of great design on the web. It lets us\r\nbuild clear, focused products. And if becoming a designer interests you, this\r\ncourse is for you. You’ll learn that design is a methodical approach to\r\nproblem solving and how to apply it to real-world problems.\r\n\r\nYou'll gain experience from day one. Starting with creating user stories to\r\nunderstand customers and exploring concepts like color theory, typography, and\r\nvisual hierarchy. As with all Thinkful courses, you’ll practice new concepts\r\nand hard skills (like Photoshop) by digging into projects that build your\r\nportfolio. At each step you'll have an experienced designer by your side to\r\nhelp you tackle difficult design decisions.",
