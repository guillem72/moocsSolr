Devices can range from connected coffee makers, cars, or\r\nsensors on cattle to connected machines in a production plant. These devices\r\nprovide data that offers new insights, and as they talk to each other, they\r\ndevelop their own intelligence and can advise customers about optimal ways to\r\nput them to use. This will revolutionize consumer habits and the way we do\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nFor this openSAP course, we have invited two of the leading experts in the\r\nfield, Henning Kagermann and Bernd Leukert. They will share their views on the\r\nInternet of Things, how it will change society and transform businesses, as\r\nwell as discuss which enabling technologies are instrumental for making use of\r\nthe Internet of Things, and the challenges and opportunities that lie before\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThis course is aimed at anyone interested in learning about the Internet of\r\nThings. You donâ€™t need to have any technical knowledge as everything is\r\nexplained easily and informally.\r\n\r\nAfter completing the course, you will be able to explain key terms and trends\r\naround the Internet of Things. You will have an understanding of the potential\r\nand value of the Internet of Things and Smart Services, and you will\r\nunderstand the opportunities and benefits for society, companies, and\r\nconsumers.\r\n\r\nThis is a special edition openSAP course; your total learning time will be\r\njust two to three hours. The course is broken down into eight units consisting\r\nof one video per unit, with self-tests for you to complete after each section.\r\nYour results will not be saved; they are just for your personal use.
