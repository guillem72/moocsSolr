    "description": "This\n course discusses the computational approach in modern physics in a \nclear yet accessible way. Individual modules contain in-depth \ndiscussions of algorithms ranging from basic enumeration methods to cutting-edge Markov-chain techniques. Emphasis will be put on \napplications in classical and quantum physics. The focus\n will be on subjects such as Monte Carlo sampling, molecular \ndynamics, transition phases in hard-sphere liquids, simulated annealing \nfor solving geometrical constraints, perfect sampling of classical spin \nmodels, to aspects of quantum Monte Carlo algorithms, Bose-Einstein \ncondensation, and many-body physics with fermions. The emphasis is on orientation. Discussion of implementation details will be kept to a minimum.\n\nThe course is entirely\nself-contained. It heavily relies on concise algorithms  (each\nwith between 10 and  50 lines of Python code). Modules lead from\nelementary discussions to the rich and difficult problems in\ncontemporary physics, and are of interest to a wide range of students\nin the natural sciences. In this course you will learn a whole lot of modern physics (classical and quantum) from basic computer programs that you will download, generalize, or write from scratch, discuss, and then hand in. Join in if you are curious (but not necessarily knowledgeable) about algorithms, and about the deep insights into science that you can obtain by the algorithmic approach.",
