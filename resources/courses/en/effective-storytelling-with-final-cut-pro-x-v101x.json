The course covers key concepts such as building a primary\nstoryline, evaluating content and pacing, trimming distracting clips, creating\ndifferent story versions, and storyboarding. The course also explores how to\ncapture and organize media, incorporate B-roll cutaways, apply the Ken Burns\neffect to still images, re-time music and clips, and add finishing touches.  \n  \nNote: This course was updated to reflect the changes to Final Cut Pro X v.\n10.1.x. Although the course was not re-recorded from scratch, we updated the\napplicable movies by adding text overlays to guide you through existing\nchanges. We also updated the exercise files to work with the most current\nversion of the software. Please watch the \"Understanding this update and using\nthe exercise files\" movie to learn exactly what to expect from this updated\ncourse. Working with an earlier version of Final Cut Pro X?
