You check out user reviews on Amazon and pick one,\ndownload that movie on BitTorrent or stream that in Netflix. But suddenly the WiFi logo on your phone is gone and you're on 3G. Video quality starts to degrade, but you don't know if it's the server getting crowded or the Internet is congested somewhere.\nIn any case, it costs you $10 per Gigabyte, and you decide to stop watching the movie, and instead multitask between sending tweets and calling your friend on Skype, while songs stream from iCloud to your phone. You're happy with the call quality, but\nget a little irritated when you see there're no new followers on Twitter. You may wonder how they all kind of work, and why sometimes they don't.
